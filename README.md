# ToDo:
* Include demonstration on how to extend the taxonomy with a third-party, non-open taxonomy, carrying broader/narrower/equivalent relations. Refer to and include the example of the counterfeit iphone.
* Include a 'Usage' section
* Add a reference to Documentation Page, create that one  'current vocabulary' due to expected constant flux of vocabulary

# Vocabulary of Devices and their Types (Voc-DT)
An open SKOS vocabulary on types of devices as a best-effort-taxonomy. A device might be inferrable to be a surveillance camera, but might not have a known market model, or might be completely custom-built. The intention of this vocabulary is therefore to allow for as detailed or as abstract a designation of a device as is required for your application. 

## Contribution
Every vocabulary is subject to evolution, particularly a vocabulary about technology. New devices are emerging frequently, and this vocabulary requires frequent modification to remain in pace with new products entering the market. Contributions from you to its evolution are welcomed very much. Please refer to our [contribution manual](CONTRIBUTE.md).

Participating in open source is often a highly collaborative experience. We’re encouraged to create in public view, and we’re incentivized to welcome contributions of all kinds from people around the world. This makes the practice of open source as much social as it is technical. We apply a code of conduct about participating to this vocabulary. Please take the time to thoroughly read our [Contributor Covenant][case:coc]
